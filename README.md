- 👋 Hi, I’m @mdmba
- 👀 I’m interested in healthcare and data science using SQL and Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning medicine and data science. I'm a physician, which covers the medicine part, and I'm looking for health analytics projects while reading data science textbooks, which should satisfy the data science part. I am a fast, eager learner and would love to collaborate! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any health analytics projects you're working on. 
- 📫 How to reach me .. email me at mdmbagabe@gmail.com!
